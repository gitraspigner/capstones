### üìù Description
Contains a collection of my capstone projects. <br>
The PDF containing most of the workshop writeups from each week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. <br>
But below you will find brief descriptions of each of the projects, which should give a better idea of their intended function and requirements. <br>
The Javadoc-style class comments I've made for each of the java files developed for each capstone were designed to be descriptive enough to give the reader a good idea of their intended function and requirements as well.

### üí≠ Capstone(s) Detailed: <br>
#### Capstone 1
- **Capstone Title:** Accounting Ledger (Command Line Application)
  - **Description:** Simulates/is an Accounting Ledger application (ran from a command line interface). The user navigates a series of menus to accomplish different basic functions of the ledger which are primarily either creating new transactions (either adding a deposit or making a payment) or displaying a report/list of transactions (deposits, payments, or transactions from a range of time). This ledger manages (stores & manipulates) transactions according to the current user running the application's input from the command line and are all written to a file (which, for this program is called "transactions.csv"). Transactions are of 2 categories: deposits (positive dollar amounts) and payments (negative dollar amounts). A transaction contains the following information: the date and time of its processing, a description of the type of deposit or (for payments) the item purchased, the name of the depositor or vendor, and the dollar amount deposited or paid.

#### üîñ Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
